Kaggle Comptitions!
I started my first competition with "Titanic" case. My first prediction lied on 77th place out 8426 competitors, Top 1%.
This was quite an exciting start, and I am developing constantly for achieving higher places and for attending other competitions!
I have done Titanic one on my own, but I would also like to join an active and eager team :)
