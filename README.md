Kaggle Comptitions!
I am enjoying my first competition with "Titanic" case. My very first prediction lied on 77th place out 8426 competitors, top 1% which was quite an exciting start for me. I am constantly developing my analysis to achieve higher places and to attend other competitions!
I have done Titanic one on my own. However, I would also like very much to join an active and eager team :)
